# IONOS-SIM
IONOS SIM HF/VHF Simulator
This project Implements an Audio based HF or VHF/UHF Ionospheric Propogation Channel Simulator. It is based on the common Waterson model
and is implemented using the Teensy 4.0 microprocessor ( www.prjc.com ). The simulator uses support chips for audio processing and  
user interface components.  It makes extensive use of the Teensy Audio Library for many DSP functions. The Simulator can be used to
simulate (using audio from modems or sound cards) propagation using 5 Different HF channels and 3 Different VHF Channel types. 
The software for the Teensy is released under the MIT Open Source Initiative.  The documentation includes Power Point slides of the 
simulator and how it is used, the full specifications of the simulator, and a basic setup and operating guide. The Project was developed
with the support of the Amateur Radio Safety Foundation Inc a Florida 501C3 non profit corportion and the Winlink Radio Email system. 
Developers: Rick Muething, KN6KB: Tom Lafleur, KA6IQA; and Tom Whiteside, N5TW.
